    Hi,<br>
    <br>
    I'm Cl√©ment, I am passionate about computer science and electronics since I am 12.<br>
    <br>
    Now I specialize in backend software (embedded C ; C++/QT ; python), but front end can also be fun (angular). Constantly picking up new skills by myself, ideas always pop up in my mind.<br>
    <br>
    Friendly and reliable I will always prefer to build a script than do twice the same thing by hand.
