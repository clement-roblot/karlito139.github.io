    Hi,<br>
    <br>
    I'm Clément, I am passionate about computer science and electronics since I am 12.<br>
    <br>
    Now I specialize at the frontier between those two world (embedded C and C++/QT). Constantly picking up new skills by myself, ideas always pop up in my mind.<br>
    <br>
    Friendly and reliable I will always prefer to build a script than do twice the same thing by hand.



<!-- I got a lot of experience in small microcontroleur, so I know how to optimise code, and I am attentive to mémory usage.

Maybe put my age, and experience in a job

I am available to work as a freelance -->
