<h2><b>Concept</b></h2>
<hr>
This software is simply an interface for using youtube-dl (here) as a video feed downloader. You simply log yourself to youtube and the application will automatically download the latest videos from the channels you follow on youtube. The videos will be saved on your computer as a regular video file.

<h3><b>Major Points</b></h3>
<hr>
<div class="row">
   <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
      <div class="tiles m-b-10">
         <div class="tiles-body">
            <div class="tiles-title">Install and forget</div>
            <hr class="red-underline">
            One of the biggest goal was to make this application invisible. The point was to install it and forget about it. It should be running and downloading videos whenever possible without disturbing the user.

   </div>
   <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
      <div class="tiles m-b-10">
         <div class="tiles-body">
            <div class="tiles-title">UI</div>
            <hr class="red-underline">
				The UI was designed to be minimalistic and display as little info as possible to be clear and easy to read when interacting with the software.

<h2><b>Focus on</b></h2>
<hr>
This project was started in 2014 out of my own needs (because of the bandwidth limitation of my ISP). Since then it evolved and followed the modification of the youtube platform itself. Today this application is still perfectly usable. You can find more informations about it <a href="https://localtube.org">here</a>, and the source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/localtube/localtube">github</a>.
