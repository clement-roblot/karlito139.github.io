<h2><b>Concept</b></h2>
<hr>
Continuous improvement on an internal software allowing to draw technical plans of boats.
<h3><b>Major Points</b></h3>
<hr>
<div class="row">
   <div class="col-xs-4 col-md-4 col-sm-12">
      <div class="tiles m-b-10">
         <div class="tiles-body">
            <div class="tiles-title">Bug</div>
            <hr class="red-underline">
            Read the bug description and locate the source of the error within the code.
         </div>
      </div>
   </div>
   <div class="col-xs-4 col-md-4 col-sm-12">
      <div class="tiles m-b-10">
         <div class="tiles-body">
            <div class="tiles-title">Correction</div>
            <hr class="red-underline">
				Once the source of the error has been corrected, the unit and functional tests must be checked for consistency. In case of worries, it is necessary to re-write all the tests by mindmaps then coding them.

            Increased stability for users.

<h2><b>Focus on</b></h2>
<hr>
The addition of different functionalities within this software must be preceded by the creation of tests (TDD process) in the format of a mindmap. They allow to define all the cases of uses (normal ones and those causing errors) to facilitate coding.
<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: Requirements are turned into very specific test cases, then the software is improved to pass the new tests, only.</blockquote>
