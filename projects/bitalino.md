<h2><b>Concept</b></h2>
<hr>
Development of an application which measure muscular impact on a person of a virtual reality application on 1D and 2D. To do this, we used the EMG module of the <a href="http://bitalino.com/en/" target="_blank">BITalino</a> acquisition card.<br/><br/>
As a reminder, 
<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromyography">Electromyography (EMG) is an electrodiagnostic medicine technique for evaluating and recording the electrical activity produced by skeletal muscles. EMG is performed using an instrument called an electromyograph to produce a record called an electromyogram. An electromyograph detects the electric potential generated by muscle cells[2] when these cells are electrically or neurologically activated. The signals can be analyzed to detect medical abnormalities, activation level, or recruitment order, or to analyze the biomechanics of human or animal movement.</blockquote>

<h2><b>Focus on</b></h2>
<hr>
<h3>Application</h3>
The objective for the user is to match the blue shape to the red shape as quickly as possible.
The measurement scenario is as follows:
<ul>
<li>The user observes the environment;</li>
<li>When it is ready (cursor on the blue shape either with the mouse or with the LeapMotion), it presses the space key;</li>
<li>It complements the scenario;</li>
<li>It validates its acquisition by pressing the space key.</li>
</ul>

<br/>
<h3>Acquisition</h3>
Throughout the game phase, all of the following values are saved to a file for later analysis.
<ul>
<li>Target Amplitude: Corresponds to the width between the centers of the bands;</li>
<li>Target Width: Corresponds to the bandwidth of the target band;</li>
<li>Mouse Down: Corresponds to the time elapsed between the beginning of exercise sound and the selection of the starting rectangle by the user in milliseconds;</li>
<li>Mouse Enter: Matches the elapsed time between the selection of the starting rectangle by the user and the moment the cursor enters the arrival rectangle in milliseconds;</li>
<li>Movement Time: Time in milliseconds between click and click release;</li>
<li>Target Re-Entry: An integer value corresponding to the number of times the user collides with the arrival form;</li>
<li>Task Axis Crossing: Corresponds to the number of times the cursor crosses the ideal path between the two rectangles;</li>
<li>Movement Direction Change: Corresponds to the number of times a change of direction occurs during the journey between the start and end points;</li>
<li>Orthogonal Direction Change: Corresponds to the number of times an orthogonal axis change is present;</li>
<li>Movement Variability: Corresponds to the distance between the coordinates of a point and its equivalent on the ideal path between the two rectangles;</li>
<li>Movement Error: This is the average difference between the sampling points from the work axis, regardless of whether the points are above or below the axis;</li>
<li>Movement Offset: The mean deviation of y;</li>
<li>Success: A Boolean value indicating whether the slider is within the area of ​​the finish rectangle when the click is released.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
At the end of the acquisition, we have in one file the measures relative to the scenario and in another, the EMG values.
Thanks to the synchronization of times, we can determine the forces performed as a function of time.
<h3>Architecture</h3>
The architecture of the project is divided into four distinct developments.
<ul>
<li>For the recovery of the EMG values from the BITalino card;</li>
<li>For the graphical part of the scenario, interactions with controllers and retrieval of measurements;</li>
<li>To synchronize the two software of the first two points;</li>
<li>For the correlation of the set of values.</li>
</ul>
Below is a summary.
